# CRA

It's just the good ol' CRA, but better. This is particularly useful for people who enter hackathons and they'd like to start the whole thing with some kind of bootstraping done for them. If this is you as well, fear not! I got us both.

Removed boilerplate, showing only some text.

Redux is set up. With thunk. It has a combined reducer so you can add more than one store to keep your data.

React router dom is already installed.

Feel free to clone this repo, run ```npm install``` and enjoy cra without hassle.

The readme has some links to UI libraries for react as well:

- [Material UI](https://mui.com/getting-started/installation/)
- [Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/usage)
